This is the rounded version of the robot shell. This version was designed as 
an improvement on the square, weighing much less, and having a much sleeker 
appearance. It is also much simpler to assemble.

The RobotModel(4) file is the model I designed as a digital reference to the 
real world. all of the measurements are accurate to within 1/24''. I personally
much prefer metric, but this lab uses imperial units, so that is what I used.
