In this file are the two iterations of exterior facade I designed and 3D printed 
for the robotics project. There were only multiple iterations due to changing
requirements.

The first iteration was a blocky, segmented design. It is constructed out of 16
interlocking pieces. The reason for this is that the print volume of the printer 
we were using was very limited. Each of these segments is optimized to fit the 
print volume, while not being disproportionate. They fit together with two pins
or two holes on each mating face. The tolerances used allowed them to fit snuggly
without slipping, so they were entirely friction bonded, and functioned very well.

The second iteration is a rounded, streamlined design consisting of few segmented 
pieces. after the first iteration, the lab gained access to a much larger printer,
and was able to print much larger sections as a result. This presented its own 
challenges, as it was very difficult to coordinate the type of plastic used, due
to the fact that it was a universtiy printer that I did not have direct access to,
but could only email part files to the department head, and during prototyping they
frequently used whatever filament was already loaded in the machine, which led to
several reprinted parts from ABS to the intended black PLA once the parts were 
determined to fit. The rounded design was designed as a gravity-based design, with 
all of the parts sitting on top of something to hold them in place. This allowed 
greater mechanical stability over the blocky iteration, as well as much greater ease 
of maintenince. This iteration is designed to be removed and assembled in a specific
order to allow for quick access to the internal components, without compromising the 
structural integrity of the shell.
