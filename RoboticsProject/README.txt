This folder contains two videos of the robot I
have been working on in the research department of the 
Advanced Technology Research Center. It also contains folders 
with the progress that has been made since. I was responsible 
for redesigning and rebuilding the entire physical 
structure of the robot. (This is because I am the only mechanical 
engineering student in an electrical engineering lab, and I 
am working on a team of 4 people) 

This drastic redesign was necesary because the robot was 
originally wobbly and unstable, and would flex in the center,
causing the camera to not be level. Additionally, the wheels 
of the robot were poorly attached, causing skewed and erratic 
movement. These are all critical problems, because this robot 
is used for following a person who is walking, and taking precise 
measurements of the geometry of the natural human gait, 
for use in creating prosthetics, braces, and bipedal robots.
After redesigning and rebuilding the robot, I had solved 
all of these problems. As shown, the robot now runs smoothly.

"RobotOverview" is a shot that shows the overall 
shape of the original prototype of the robot.

"FollowTest" is a demonstration of the robot 
following me, and shows that the prototype robot is now perfectly 
stable and level.
