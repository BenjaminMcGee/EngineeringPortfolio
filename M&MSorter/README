This folder contains the 3D models I designed and
printed when creating a machine that sorts M&M's
by color. I created this machine entirely 
independently, only externally assisted by the 
documentation of the products I used.
Asside from 3D printed parts, the machine included
2 stepper motors (and their drivers), one color
sensor, and an Arduino Uno. It was powered through 
an adjustable power supply, and communicated with
a desktop computer via a serial port for the purpose
of selecting a color.
When the machine was complete, a bag of M&M's could 
be poured in the top funnel, and the machine would 
sort all of the M&M's of the selected color into
the checkmark slot, and all of the other M&M's
into the other slot. The machine had an accuracy 
in excess of 97%. There was a video displaying
the machine in use on youtube, but unfortunately,
the video was taken down and no longer exists. 
Due to this, I included two low-quality images of 
the machine while its design was being finalized.
